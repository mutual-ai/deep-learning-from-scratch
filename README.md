# Deep Learning From Scratch
This repository will contain implementations of basic neural network & deep learning algorithms, from scratch using scientific python.

### Algorithms 
1. Logistic Regression
    Logistic regression can be considered a simple single layer neural network model. There is one matrix multiply followed directly by the softmax non-linearity to normalize scores (and arguably followed by a very simple threshold function to output classes)
